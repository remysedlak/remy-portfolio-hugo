**Duration:** 3 weeks

I competed in the AI in Action Hackathon hosted by Robert Morris University, where my friend Will and I collaborated with our mentor Nigel and sponsor, CacheAI, to develop a functional AI chatbot to help file and find small business tax forms. Our model was trained on IRS form metadata, sample conversations, and utilized template responses to ensure the safety of our clients and their information. We earned second place, and this was one of my favorite projects I've gotten to work on.
