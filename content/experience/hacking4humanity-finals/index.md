**Duration:** 1 month

Continuing our hackathon project from February, Devon and I were honored to present our Deepfake Detector in Harrisburg to a panel of judges, including Pennsylvania's First Lady, Lori Shapiro. The governor's residence was breathtaking, and the event emphasized the growing importance of AI ethics in real-world applications.
