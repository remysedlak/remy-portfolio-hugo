**Duration:** 24 hours

I competed in SteelHacks XII, a hackathon hosted by the University of Pittsburgh, where I collaborated with data scientists to develop an ML anxiety predictor web app for students. Our project earned third place in the "Predict the Unpredictable" track. This event was incredibly fun, and I enjoyed seeing every team's amazing innovations.
