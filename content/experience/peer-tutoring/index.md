**Duration:** 5 months

During my sophomore year, I started providing one-on-one tutoring sessions for SCI courses at Pitt, guiding students through fundamental and advanced programming concepts. This opportunity has allowed me to strengthen students' problem-solving and debug skills, while I strengthen my own communication.
