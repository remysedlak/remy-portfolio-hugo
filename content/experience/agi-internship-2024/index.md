**Duration:** 8 weeks

I secured my first technical internship at AssetGenie Inc., where I built Python automation tools integrated with GitLab and Excel to streamline data processing workflows. Gained hands-on experience in data engineering, scripting, and backend development, enhancing operational efficiency across teams. Worked in a fast-paced environment, collaborating with engineers to optimize automation processes and improve internal data management systems.
