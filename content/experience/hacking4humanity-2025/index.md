**Duration:** 2 weeks

I competed in Hacking4Humanity 2025, a hackathon focused on AI for social good, where I collaborated with a team to develop an AI-powered deepfake detection model. The project earned an Honorable Mention, and this experience deepened my passion for AI ethics, adversarial machine learning, and responsible AI development.
